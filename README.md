# BAmazon

This project is to show proficiency with databases and using command line prompts to affect them. It's a small simulation of a store front, with a customer interface, and a manager interface. Both of which affect the data in the database.

## Getting Started

Create a database using mySQL, and use gitbash or other equivalent CLI to run the files using node.JS

### prerequisites

* mySQL
* Node.JS
* Gitbash
* Vscode, or other code editors

### .env files

The only thing you need in the .env file is a password with the variable name _pass_ 

Markup : `pass=yourpasswordhere`

### Using BAmazon

Run your database as a live server in the background, and fill in some sample data. Then run either the _Customer_ or _Manager_ file. The rest is self explanatory.
